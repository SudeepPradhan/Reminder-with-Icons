Reminder app for Windows

Reminder app for Windows 10 universal app. 

A quick way to add the reminder without a hassel to select date time and write description. Just pre-create the items (with icons) for
reoccuring events, and when it comes to create reminder, simply select the item with timer. Of course you also have an option to
select date/time and description if you prefer.
